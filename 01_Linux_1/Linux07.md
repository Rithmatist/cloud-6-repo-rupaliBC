## [Linux Processes]

Processes in Linux can be divided into three categories: Daemons, Services, and Programs.
A daemon runs in the background and is non-interactive. A Service responds to requests from programs. A service may be interactive. A program is run and used by users (e.g. Vim).

In order to connect to remote Linux machines (virtual or not), you can use ssh (secure shell). To make this connection to your machine possible, youâ€™ll have to start the ssh service by starting the ssh daemon.

A process is an instance of running code. All code is stored in files somewhere on the system. In order to find these files, Linux will look in the $PATH variable (more about that in a later exercise). Every process has its own PID (Process ID) number.


## Key-terms
- SSH is the primary way to connect to remote Linux and Unix-like servers through the command line. It provides a secure connection that you can use to run commands, interact with the system, and even tunnel unrelated traffic through.
- The SSH daemon-  sshd provides secure, encrypted access to Linux servers.
- Process ID - Process identifier, also known as process ID or PID, is a unique number to identify each process running in an operating system such as Linux, Windows, and Unix. PIDs are reused over time and can only identify a process during the lifetime of the process, so it does not identify processes that are no longer running

## Opdracht
- Start the ssh daemon.
- Find out the PID of the ssh daemon.
- Find out how much memory the sshd is using.
- Stop or kill the sshd process.
