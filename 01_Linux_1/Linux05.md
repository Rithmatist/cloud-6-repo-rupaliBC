Linux has users, similar to accounts on Windows and MacOS. Every user has their own home directory. Users can also be part of groups.
There is a special user called ‘root’. Root is allowed to do anything.
To gain temporary root permissions, you can type ‘sudo’ in front of a command, but that only works if you’re allowed to do that.
