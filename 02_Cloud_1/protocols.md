# Protocols
A network protocol is an agreement we humans have made about how computers communicate with each other. These agreements make it possible for the Internet to exist without having to use a different standard for each connection.
The OSI model is a good tool to describe where a protocol 'lives' and what the purpose of a protocol is. Often enough, a protocol 'lives' in several layers of the OSI model.
